# This
is a repo for mockups developed for Budgie 11 for Solus and the Solus Project. **This are in-progress-files and are not always well organized.**
Here is a link to the issue on the Budgie Desktop repo: [>> Here <<](https://github.com/budgie-desktop/budgie-desktop/issues/763)

# Budgie 11
Budgie 11 will definitely bring some good enhancements and one of them is its look and feel - or the theme. As planned by project leader Ikey Doherty Budgie 11 will ship with an updated or even completely new theme, thus now is a good time to talk about in which direction it should go and what aspects are important. For this reason I want to share some ideas in the form of mockups specifically made for Budgie 11.

These mockups are made to raise discussion about the design that will be in Budgie 11. I am not a team member of the Solus project. Also, not all UI components are finished yet and they get added while time goes by and discussion evolves.

# Mockups!
I tried to make things as tangible as possible and please be ugly about the details so it can improve.
There are separate mockups for all the corresponding UI elements. Also, all images are available as a .svg file and thus easily editable.
For more details on the images view them full screen.

### Colors
Currently used colors:
* #5294e2 (Solus blue)
* #212121
* #757575
* #e0e0e0
* #eeeeee

### Panel
The height of the panel is 39px, just like it is today in Budgie. The main difference with this design is the color selection. Also as can be seen in the other images spacing has been generally increased - especially the "dock" on the rightmost.

### Menu

### End Session Dialog

### Raven
The sidebar is a crucial part of the desktop experience and should get a lot of attention to make it a great user experience.

Here is everything on one picture:

More importantly, these Raven mockups take care of almost all things pointed out from Ikey Doherty:
- [x] Return to Widgets & Notifications only
- [x] Move Settings out completely
- [ ] Resizable
- [x] Switch to drawer mode - i.e. overlap panels
- [x] Group notifications by application
- [x] "Quiet Mode" (do not disturb)
- [x] Richer notifications (Actionable)
- [x] Dismiss on group basis.

### Notifications
_Not yet finished_

### PolicyKit

# The Whole Thingâ„¢
~So for you to be happy, of course there is a all in one file. **But**... be cautious: Maybe you would not expect this but it is pretty power intensive to all those elements at once (especially the shadows), so a decently fast computer is needed if you want to edit them.~
